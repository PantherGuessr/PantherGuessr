## Supported Versions

We update this project consistently following the semantic versioning system outlined [here](https://semver.org/). Listed below is a complete list of versions that we officially support.

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| X.X.X-alpha | :x:                |
| X.X.X-beta  | :white_check_mark: |

- Note: To understand this table, focus on the parts of the version that don't contain the letter X as that represents a catch all for anything in that place.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in our website, we ask that you send an email to [security@pantherguessr.com](mailto:security@pantherguessr.com) containing as much information as possible. We will then follow up with you there to improve our website.

If the vulnerability is major, please avoid publicizing it until after we have resolved it.
